# System alias file - try to fetch ftn-style aliases from there.
# If "from" address of a message from FidoNet matches _right_ side
# of some entry in sysalias file, then the Reply-To: header is created
# in the RFC message with the name part taken from the left side of the
# sysalis entry and domain part taken from myfqdn (below). E.g., if a 
# fidonet message comes from "John Smith of 1:234/567.89@fidonet" and 
# there is an entry in the sysalias file:
# "jsmith:	John.Smith@p89.f567.n234.z1.fidonet.org"
# and fqdn value is "pccross.msk.su", then the resulting message will
# contain a line: "Reply-To: jsmith@pccross.msk.su".

# If this is specified, The "To:" line at the beginning of the fidonet message
# will be kept in consideration _only_ if the message is addresses to the name
# specified. Thus, defining a magicname prevents the problems of different
# adresses in To: line and enveloppe. This is specially the case in mailing
# lists. Without defining a magicname if you are in a mailing list messages
# will be bounced back as the To: line doesn't show your address but the ML one

# the numbers starting with "7-" but not with "7-095-", the country prefix
# "7-" is stripped and the long-distance dialing prefix "8W" substituted. 
# For the numbers not matching any of the above, international
# call is performed: international dialing prefix "8W10" is prepended
