.SH NAME
.B	dumpfidomsg
\- Convert Fidonet messages to RFC-822.
.PP
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B	dumpfidomsg
[-h]  [-x verbosity]  [-I file]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dumpfidomsg
converts Fidonet messages into RFC-822 internet mail or RFC-1036 Usenet News
format. It expects a Fidonet message on stdin (in the format produced by
programs such as msged, from https://github.com/jrnutt/msged) and passes the
converted mail message to stdout.
.PP
.B dumpfidomsg
tries to preserve as much information as possible
in "X-FTN-..." headers and "^ARFC-..." kludges, and restore messages more
or less accurately to their original form when double-gatewaying.
.PP
If you make a system mail alias file accessible to the program, it makes
attempt to "backward resolve" the "from" addresses, that is, if the originating
address of the FidoNet message matches the right side of some mail alias, the
"Reply-To:" header of the generated mail/news message will contain
"alias@your.domain.name" address.
.PP
Message IDs are converted as follows: "^AMSGID: <address> <hexnum>" is
converted to "<decimalnum>@<address>". If there was no MSGID in the
fidonet message, messageid of the form <creation-time>@<from-address> is
generated, so that when a single message is gatewayed in several distinct
places, it will have the same messageid anyway (for some (little) risk of
having two different messages with the same messageid). RFC822 Message-IDs
are converted back when they can be, otherwise the messageid
"<local>@<domain>" is converted to "^AMSGID <domain> crc32(<local>)".
When an RFC message is split, unique MSGIDs are generated for all parts
after the first one. In any case, the original "Message-ID:" header is
preserved in the "^ARFC-Message-ID:" kludge and used if the message comes
back to USENET on some (other) gateway.
.PP
Several aspects of the conversion can be specified in the configuration file.
These include character set conversions to be performed on messages to convert
them into standard encodings, and e-mail address mappings. See the sample
configuration file for more details.
.B dumpfidomsg
coexists with and shares configuration files from
.B ifmail
when available.
